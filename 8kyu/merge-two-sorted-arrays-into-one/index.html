</head>
<body>
   <h1>Merge two sorted arrays into one</h1>
   <p>You are given two sorted arrays that both only contain integers. Your task is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in asc order. Complete the function <code>mergeArrays(arr1, arr2)</code>, where <code>arr1</code> and <code>arr2</code> are the original sorted arrays.</p>

   <p>You don't need to worry about validation, since arr1 and arr2 must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both arr1 and arr2 are empty, then just return an empty array.</p>
      
   <p>Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove duplicated in the returned result.</p>
